# define a simple search function
search keywords
Define a search function in Python. Goal is to output the keywords from a list and the sentence(s) from adele.txt that contain(s) the keywords.

This is a user defined list, for example, userlist=['looking','for','wanna'], user can put in anything in a list.
We are going to loop thru the userlist and list all the matches in the txt file, if we cannot find the string in the tex file, the function will return an empty list[].

This is the link for the original txt file
